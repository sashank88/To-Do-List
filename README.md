This is a simple to-do list that i created with HTML, CSS, EJS, Express, Mongodb and Nodejs.

You can also create a custom list where you can add and delete your tasks. You can create and access your custom list just by writing the name of the list after the url. 

localhost:3000/nameOfCustomList
